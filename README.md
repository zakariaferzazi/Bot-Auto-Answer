# Bot-Auto-Answer
Bot Auto-Answer (bored panda to quora)

I Created this Script with a simple GUI in order to make my work easy, because my work requires me to copy the content from "Bored Panda" and paste it into "Quora" as an answer with a link to my blog, and with this, I will send visitors to my site.
This script consists of 375 lines of code (Python).
I know that it is an easy thing and not that difficult, but like any aspiring programmer, I always try to improve my skills in order to keep pace with the development of all technologies.

Script actions steps:

1-browse article link (bored panda).
2-copy all data i need for the answer in quora(data: title-img-text)
3-browse rebrandly to make short link of article in bored panda and copy it( i use rebrandly because he makes me able to change link later and put the link of my blog)
4-browse notepad online and past all data and copy it as an answer consistently
5-browse quora.com and login
6-browse link of question I need to answer it
7-click button answer and past data and click to submit

Libraries I use in this script :

Tkinter : create GUI for script python.
Selenium Webdriver : create autotest, scraping information from different websites.
Pyautogui : Used to programmatically control the mouse & keyboard.
Pickle : give you the option to save data like(email&pass of quora) into file.dat and use them later without entering it again and again
pyinstaller : make you able to convert your script.py to app.exe (work on any windows without IDLE).

My English is not so good. so thank you for your visit I hope you contact me if you need anything.
